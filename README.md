# CS262-CalvinRank

At Calvin University, students, professors, and faculty face challenges regarding campus food options, such as navigating expensive meal plans and finding foods that meet their dietary requirements and preferences. This has led to upperclassmen students preferring to cook their own meals, and on campus students preferring to order takeout meals. This leads to food waste and overcooking in the dining halls since not every student who has a meal plan is using it each meal. Knight Bites addresses these issues by providing a platform where Calvin's community can rate and review food offerings, allowing the dining halls to make informed choices about their dining options.

Available products in the major food locations (Johnny's, Knollcrest Dining, Commons Dining, Uppercrust, and Peet's) will be able to be rated from 1 to 5 stars, and its average rating will be displayed for all users. Similarly to Calvinâ€™s dining hall app Eatable, Knight Bites will list the available products at each area to evaluate the popularity of the daily food choices. Average ratings can help indecisive students identify well liked menu items and provide suggestions on what to order. The dining halls will be able to view feedback and can make decisions on what foods to phase out or make in lesser quantities. This loop will potentially reduce food waste and increase visits to the dining halls. By providing prompt feedback, Knight Bites will foster connections between dining services and Calvin University students, all while allowing the dining halls to adapt to student preference and need.
